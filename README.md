## A game coded in the C programming language

## How to play:
- Once your pair of UCFK4s have compiled and downloaded the program, you should be greeted with scrolling text, "PUSH TO BAT". Go ahead and choose which of the two players will be batting first by having one of you press the navswitch in.
- The batter should see two pixels, and the pitcher should see just one. Both players can move east and west for the time being. The pitcher, however, is choosing a lane to pitch down. Once they push in the navswitch again they will see a power meter oscillating up and down. The pitcher should try and time their next navswitch push to maximise how strong their pitch is.
- Immediately, the ball will be pitched and the batter must be in the correct lane, and push up (north) on their navswitch at the right time, to successfully swing at the ball.
- If you do manage to hit it, run around the bases (anticlockwise) as fast as you can with the navswitch, before the pitcher fields the ball you just hit.
- After three strikes, the players swap roles, and whoever ran around the most bases by the end is the winner! (In the case of a tie, the winner is the person who started batting)
- To play again, simply push in the navswitch on both FunKits, and you are back to the start!
